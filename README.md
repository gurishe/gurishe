# Hello! I'm Ernie Gurish ðŸ‘‹  

I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Northeastern University while working full-time as a Registrar at The Rivers School Conservatory. 
In my past positions I have worked closely with a variety of registration databases and online banking sub-systems. 
These experiences have forged me into an active learner and proactive problem solver. 

My experiences in customer-facing roles has taught me how to be an empathic, confident communicator. 
Working for smaller organizations has had me wearing many hats in my various roles. 
This has taught me how to adapt to new problems as they arise and prevent them before they occur. 
I am energized by these new challenges and enjoy the discovery process in solving them.

In my MSCS program I am actively laying the foundation to build upon my technical skills. 
I have programmed in Python, C, Java, R, and SQL, worked with a variety of database management systems like MySQL and DynamoDB, and have most recently started working the AWS Web Services like EC2, RDS, and S3. 
Some of my recent academic projects have included creating a RESTful web server linked to a remote database, implementing TCP/IP using raw sockets, and designing a MySQL database. 

My current goal is to find an internship or co-op that will allow me to deepen my technical skills with real-world experience and provide a strong starting point for a full-time career in the world of technology.
